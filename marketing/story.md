My personal journey begun before nine years ago. For these period I "visited" a signigication amout of kingdoms 👑. My roles were "warrior" (backend developer), "engineer" (front - end developer), "magician" (team leader and software architect), "the assassin" (freelancer) and even the "main officer" (CTO). 

When I worked like a warrior 💪 I wrote a significant amout of scripts which automated some boring repative tasks for my stackholders and the end - users.

To be an engineer 🛠 is an awesome job because your main focus is creating a beautiful and helpful instruments which reduce the main pain of each system: Adding or filtering data.

The magician role 🧙‍♀️ was a tough and motivational task. My leadership skills cut the deadlines, improve code quality and the final result was: strong and long partnership.

Like an assassin 🔪 I learned how to be a solo player. I improved my skills to complete: fast and efficient stackholder requirements.

I'm looking for next kingdom.
