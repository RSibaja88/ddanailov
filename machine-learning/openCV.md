# OpenCV

## What is OpenCV

- Open source Computer vision library
- Highly optimized C++ code
- C++, Python and Java interfaces

## Uses of OpenCV

- Capturing video/image streams
- Pre-processing of images(resizing, changing color space)
- CV techniques like Canny Edge Detection on up to machine learning classifiers

## Useful OpenCV function

- `VideoCapture` - can read in a video or image and extract a frame it for processing
- `resize` - is used to resize a given frame
- `cvtColor` can convert between color spaces.
- `rectangle` - useful for drawing bounding boxes onto an output image
- `imwrite` - useful for saving down a given image

## Basic OpenCV Functions & Syntax

- cv2.VideoCapture
- cv2.resize
- cv2.cvtColor
- cv2.rectangle
- cv2.imwrite
