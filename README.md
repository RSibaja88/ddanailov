### Client feedback: 

> "Dimitar helped to build a new solution for a current product that needed revisions based on usage in a newer OS. He worked with our enterprise architect and a dedicated dev team and QA team to define requirements, ask questions, and to think ahead of our solution. He was punctual, positive, and helped to drive the process forward on a daily basis. Thanks for your help, Dimitar!" 

`Heidi Lund, Associate Product Manager at Questar Assessment Inc.` (October 2017)

> "Dimitar Danailov led the development work on our primary project management and production application from 2013 to 2015. He and his team took over the responsibility for supporting and updating our existing application written in VB on ASP.NET, and they developed a new application written in C# on ASP.NET MVC. Both applications ran on Microsoft Azure and used a SQL database. The applications covered functionality ranging from CRM, a vendor database, production tasks for our operations team working on translation and localisation projects, and finance. I was impressed by Dimitar’s technical skills – as a solutions architect designing both front-end and back-end, his efficient coding and his ability to propose elegant solutions to meet our requirements. Dimitar was proactive in suggesting new technical approaches to overcome our particular challenges and I appreciated his willingness to research new technologies specifically for our project. Dimitar displayed admirable personal commitment in investing his personal time to work on our project and I considered him a true partner in our endeavour. I have no hesitation in recommending Dimitar and I am confident that he will be an asset to any employer."

`Henry Clough, Managing Director Asian Absolute` (October 2015)

> "Even though my time with Dimitar was limited, I found him consistently pleasant, professional, and tackled all programming assignments with dedication and a view of total success. Besides being a joy to work with, Dimitar is a take - charge person who is able to present creative ideas and communicate the benefits. I highly recommend Dimitar for employment. He is a team player and would make a great asset of any organization."
