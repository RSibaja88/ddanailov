My personal journey begun before nine years ago. For these period I "visited" a signification amount of kingdoms 👑. My roles were "warrior" (backend developer), "engineer" (front - end developer), "magician" (team leader and software architect), "the assassin" (freelancer) and even the "main officer" (CTO). 

When I worked like a warrior 💪 I wrote a significant amount of scripts which automated some boring repetitive tasks for my stakeholders and the end - users.

To be an engineer 🛠 is an awesome job because your main focus is creating a beautiful and helpful instruments which reduce the main pain of each system: Adding or filtering data.

The magician role 🧙‍♀️ was a tough and motivational task. My leadership skills cut the deadlines, improve code quality and the final result was: strong and long partnership.

Like an assassin 🔪 I learned how to be a solo player. I improved my skills to complete: fast and efficient stakeholders requirements.

I'm looking for the next kingdom 🏯

### Client feedback: 

> "Dimitar helped to build a new solution for a current product that needed revisions based on usage in a newer OS. He worked with our enterprise architect and a dedicated dev team and QA team to define requirements, ask questions, and to think ahead of our solution. He was punctual, positive, and helped to drive the process forward on a daily basis. Thanks for your help, Dimitar!" 

[`Heidi Lund, Associate Product Manager at Questar Assessment Inc.` (October 2017)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/heidilundproductmanager)

> "Dimitar Danailov led the development work on our primary project management and production application from 2013 to 2015. He and his team took over the responsibility for supporting and updating our existing application written in VB on ASP.NET, and they developed a new application written in C# on ASP.NET MVC. Both applications ran on Microsoft Azure and used a SQL database. The applications covered functionality ranging from CRM, a vendor database, production tasks for our operations team working on translation and localisation projects, and finance. I was impressed by Dimitar’s technical skills – as a solutions architect designing both front-end and back-end, his efficient coding and his ability to propose elegant solutions to meet our requirements. Dimitar was proactive in suggesting new technical approaches to overcome our particular challenges and I appreciated his willingness to research new technologies specifically for our project. Dimitar displayed admirable personal commitment in investing his personal time to work on our project and I considered him a true partner in our endeavour. I have no hesitation in recommending Dimitar and I am confident that he will be an asset to any employer."
