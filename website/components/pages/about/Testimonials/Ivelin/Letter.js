      <p>
        I am writing this recommendation for Dimitar Danailov with great
        pleasure and respect. Dimitar has worked for me and with me for more
        than five years in 158Ltd. He has started as programmer and passed all
        the levels to CTO in the last year. In terms of technical skills, he has
        an undeniable qualification, but for me and for the company he was
        highly esteemed for his loyalty and devotion. He is a person with whom I
        have worked with pleasure and I have had unreserved confidence in him,
        since we have managed more than 100 projects in time and he has proven
        his competence and his ability to work on time and with quality. Rarely,
        we can meet people strongly devoted to their work, however Dimitar is
        one of them, and the priceless thing for him is that he transfers his
        energy and knowledge to the team, motivates them and he is one good
        example.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the beginning he has demonstrated a strict compliance to the
        working processes and rules of the company. By taking the position of
        CTO in 158Ltd. Together with his help we have built the team from the
        base of three programmers to the current 28. Over the past years, we
        have participated in many risky projects and in his face I have always
        had a confidential and pragmatic partner in making quick and right
        decisions
      </p>
      <p>
        In conclusion, let me say that without hesitation I recommend Dimitar
        Danailov for the position lead programmer, related to software
        development. I am sure that he is going to be an invaluable asset for
        your organization. If you would like to discuss further my opinion and
        assessment of Dimitar, please do not hesitate to contact me
      </p>
