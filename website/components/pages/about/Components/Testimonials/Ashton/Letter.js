      pleasant, professional, and tackled all programming assignments with
      dedication and a view of total success. Besides being a joy to work with,
      Dimitar is a take - charge person who is able to present creative ideas
      and communicate the benefits. I highly recommend Dimitar for employment.
      He is a team player and would make a great asset of any organization."
