        My personal journey begun before ten years ago. For these period I
        "visited" a signification amount of kingdoms 👑. My roles were "warrior"
        (backend developer), "engineer" (front - end developer), "magician"
        (team leader and software architect), "the assassin" (freelancer) and
        even the "main officer" (CTO).

        When I worked like a warrior 💪 I wrote a significant amount of scripts
        which automated some boring repetitive tasks for my stakeholders and the
        end - users.

        To be an engineer 🛠 is an awesome job because your main focus is
        creating a beautiful and helpful instruments which reduce the main pain
        of each system: Adding or filtering data.

        The magician role 🧙‍♀️ was a tough and motivational task. My leadership
        skills cut the deadlines, improve code quality and the final result was:
        strong and long partnership.

        Like an assassin 🔪 I learned how to be a solo player. I improved my
        skills to complete: fast and efficient stakeholders requirements.
