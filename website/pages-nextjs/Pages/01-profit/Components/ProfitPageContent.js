      <p>

      <Slogan>Intro</Slogan>

      <p>
        I worked in two different bussines unites eight years. After that I was
        FIRED twice in roll. August 2018 was my kickoff call. I decided to
        create my company. In the first six months my profit was 0. The good
        news were: outcome was not so big.
      </p>

      <Slogan>You’re the boss</Slogan>
      <p>
        Client relationship, in and outcome, time management, how much will be
        your rate per hour. If the end of month your company doesn't have a
        profit is YOUR FAIL.
      </p>

      <Slogan>You’re the product</Slogan>

      <p>If you've already client: Please skip the following bullet point</p>

      <p>Why ?</p>
      <p>
        Several friends are working with clients as freelancers. For them the
        transition was not so hard. The client was happy from them. My friends
        were not happy from the company and they just switch the contract. Be
        careful with NDA. The NDA angreenment can't be a huge blocker for you.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Without good marketing and selling: Your company is dead. </p>
