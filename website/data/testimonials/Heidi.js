        needed revisions based on usage in a newer OS. He worked with our
        enterprise architect and a dedicated dev team and QA team to define
        requirements, ask questions, and to think ahead of our solution. He was
        punctual, positive, and helped to drive the process forward on a daily
        basis. Thanks for your help, Dimitar!"
