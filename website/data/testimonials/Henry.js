      management and production application from 2013 to 2015. He and his team
      took over the responsibility for supporting and updating our existing
      application written in VB on ASP.NET, and they developed a new application
      written in C# on ASP.NET MVC. Both applications ran on{' '}
      <Keyword word="Microsoft Azure" /> and used a SQL database. The
      applications covered functionality ranging from CRM, a vendor database,
      production tasks for our operations team working on translation and
      localisation projects, and finance. I was impressed by Dimitar’s technical
      skills – as a <Keyword word="solutions architect" /> designing both
      <Keyword word="front-end" />
      and
      <Keyword word="back-end" />, his efficient coding and his ability to
      propose elegant solutions to meet our requirements. Dimitar was proactive
      in suggesting new technical approaches to overcome our particular
      challenges and I appreciated his willingness to research new technologies
      specifically for our project. Dimitar displayed admirable personal
      commitment in investing his personal time to work on our project and I
      considered him a true partner in our endeavour. I have no hesitation in
      recommending Dimitar and I am confident that he will be an asset to any
      employer."
