        "Dimitar helped to build a new solution for a current product that
        needed revisions based on usage in a newer OS. He worked with our
        enterprise architect and a dedicated dev team and QA team to define
        requirements, ask questions, and to think ahead of our solution. He was
        punctual, positive, and helped to drive the process forward on a daily
        basis. Thanks for your help, Dimitar!"

        "Dimitar Danailov led the development work on our primary project
        management and production application from 2013 to 2015. He and his team
        took over the responsibility for supporting and updating our existing
        application written in VB on ASP.NET, and they developed a new
        application written in C# on ASP.NET MVC. Both applications ran on
        Microsoft Azure and used a SQL database. The applications covered
        functionality ranging from CRM, a vendor database, production tasks for
        our operations team working on translation and localisation projects,
        and finance. I was impressed by Dimitar’s technical skills – as a
        solutions architect designing both front-end and back-end, his efficient
        coding and his ability to propose elegant solutions to meet our
        requirements. Dimitar was proactive in suggesting new technical
        approaches to overcome our particular challenges and I appreciated his
        willingness to research new technologies specifically for our project.
        Dimitar displayed admirable personal commitment in investing his
        personal time to work on our project and I considered him a true partner
        in our endeavour. I have no hesitation in recommending Dimitar and I am
        confident that he will be an asset to any employer."

        Dimitar is an excellent programmer and soul of the team. I am glad that
        I be given the opportunity to recommend it because I have a very
        positive impression of his personality. We spent over a year and a half
        working together in 158ltd.com. and in that time he managed to pass me a
        lot of knowledge in the IT field. Whenever I needed help or advice he
        has responded and helped me. I'm sure Dimitar would be a great part of
        every team.
