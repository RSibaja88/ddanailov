### Intro about me

I've been working as a remote independent contractor since August 2018.
My superpowers are: JavaScript, Cloud and DevOps.

My working experience includes: Chief technology officer, Software Architect, Team leader and DevOps Engineer.

### My personal story and superpowers

My personal journey begun before nine years ago. For this period I "visited" a significant amount of kingdoms 👑. My roles were "warrior" (backend developer), "engineer" (front - end developer), "magician" (team leader and software architect), "the assassin" (freelancer) and even the "main officer" (CTO).

When I worked as a warrior 💪 I wrote a significant amount of scripts which automated some boring, repetitive tasks for my stakeholders and the end - users.

To be an engineer 🛠 is an awesome job because your main focus is creating a beautiful and helpful instruments which reduce the main pain of each system: Adding or filtering data.

The magician role 🧙‍♀️ was a tough and motivational task. My leadership skills cut the deadlines, improve code quality and the final result was: strong and long partnership.

Like an assassin 🔪 I learned how to be a solo player. I improved my skills to complete: fast and efficient stakeholders requirements.

### Why I want to be part of Serverless

Serverless.js is growing so fast few years. The project has 12 000+ commits which is impressive. Serverless, containers, cloud and are not fancy words in our days. These words are mission criticial for my clients and serverless clients. Let's merge my and serverlessjs expertise to create a better product.
